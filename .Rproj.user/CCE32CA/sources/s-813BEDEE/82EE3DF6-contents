```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

## R Markdown

```{r survey}
summary(survey)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:
```{r, echo=FALSE}

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
