```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Reflection

We have to add reflection
```{r echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
library (dplyr)
library(tidyverse)
library(tidyr)
library(stringr)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggmap) 
library(ggrepel)
library(ggpubr)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(survival)
summary(survival)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
