# Ireland Travel Mode
This project was undertaken to do EDA of CSO data on a survey of people of Ireland, where they were asked questions on their office timings, duration of travel, mode of travel and other relevant
questions to understand the trends of public and private transport usage to go to workplaces. R and R Markdown has been dominantly used for EDA here, with ggplot2 at the visualizing centre.
Few questions of interest have been asked in code comments and have been answered with the visualizations following them.
